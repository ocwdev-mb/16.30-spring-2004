  "course_description": "This course focuses on the design of control systems. Topics covered include:\u00a0frequency domain and state space techniques; control law design using Nyquist diagrams and Bode plots; state feedback, state estimation, and the design of dynamic control laws;\u00a0and elementary analysis of nonlinearities and their impact on control design. There is\u00a0extensive use of computer-aided control design tools. Applications to various aerospace systems, including navigation, guidance, and control of vehicles, are also discussed.\n",
